     <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>   
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/ece/adarsha-bhattarai/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska – Lincoln</a>, specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Recognized as a Best Research Awardee by IEEE and a Best Presenter Awardee by the    University of Nebraska, my research journey has been marked by collaborations with leading medical professionals and innovative projects in medical image analysis, particularly focusing on remote ECG monitoring and CEST MRI data reconstruction.   </p>

  <p>I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://elektrikelektronikmuhendislik.iuc.edu.tr/tr/duyuru/dereceye-giren-ogrenci-listesi-65007A004F0041007200550072004200550075006A0039007900700046006200610041004F003200370077003200" target="_blank">Istanbul University</a>, where I graduated with honors and ranked 2nd in my class. Prior to that, I secured 2nd rank overall in Nepal for the Grade 12 science major, a notable achievement that was featured in a national newspaper.   </p>

  <p>My ultimate goal is to leverage my expertise in AI and healthcare technology to drive impactful advancements in medical diagnostics and patient care. During my tenure as an R&D intern at <a href="https://www.besthearttest.com/" target="_blank">Endless Health</a>, I fine-tuned generative AI models for heart disease risk assessment, integrating these findings into mobile health solutions. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and clinical applications, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.  </p>
